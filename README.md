## Local Development 🛠

Clone the repository and install dependencies with `npm i` or `yarn` and start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`. To create a bundled production build run `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

## Configuration ⚙️

By default, the client is expecting the backend to be available at `http://localhost:2800`. If you use a different port or host LOGGY yourself, you can set the address in `public/config.js` before you create a production build.

## Hosting 💻

If you want to host LOGGY yourself, but don't want to create your own production build, you can find the static files in the `dist/` folder. These files can be hosted like any other website, just make sure to update the backend URL in `dist/config.js`.
